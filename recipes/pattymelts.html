  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>This mouthwatering meal combines the comfort of a grilled cheese sandwich with the deliciousness of a cheeseburger
    into a juicy, satisfying patty melt.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound 85% lean ground beef</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Montreal-style steak seasoning</li>
    <li>6 slices country rye bread</li>
    <li>6 slices american cheese</li>
    <li>6 tbsp butter</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine ground beef, parsley, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, and steak seasoning in a bowl; mix until thoroughly
      combined. Form into 3 evenly-sized patties.</li>
    <li>Warm a nonstick griddle over medium heat. Place burgers onto the warm griddle and cook to desired doneness, 4 to
      6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71
      degrees C). Remove burgers and set aside.</li>
    <li>Warm a second griddle over medium heat. Butter 1 side of each bread slice. Place a slice of bread onto the
      griddle, butter-side down. Add a slice of cheese, a burger, and a second slice of cheese. Top with another slice
      of bread, butter-side up. Repeat with remaining burgers.</li>
    <li>Cook until bread is golden brown on the bottom, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook until the other side is golden
      brown and cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes more.</li>
  </ol>
